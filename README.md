# 👋 Hi there, I'm Romulo!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a curious and pragmatic **Data Scientist** with a passion for solving real-world problems through **experiments**, **data visualization**, and **automation**.

💼 I work with:
- 📊 **Data Science** – transforming messy data into actionable insights
- 🧪 **Experimental Design (DoE)** – building tools to optimize processes scientifically
- 🧬 **Machine Learning & Simulation** – exploring predictive models and physical systems
- ⚙️ **Python, SQL, DB2, Julia** – with a growing interest in open-source science

🌿 I’m exploring:
- Sustainable living and urban gardening 🌱
- Sensors, Raspberry Pi & embedded systems 🌡️
- Scientific computing (📦 `SciML`, `OpenFOAM`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`)

## 🛠️ Projects & Tools

Here are a few highlights from my repositories:

- [`DoEStat`](https://github.com/RomuloPires88/DoEStat): A Python toolkit for **Design of Experiments** with **Taguchi** methods, **ANOVA**, and **Response Surfaces**.
- [`MultiStat`](https://github.com/RomuloPires88/MultiStat) A Python module that provides a comprehensive and customizable tool for Hierarchical **Cluster Analysis (HCA)** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** of multivariate datasets.
- [`ens160`](https://github.com/RomuloPires88/ens160) This Python application interfaces with the **Adafruit ENS160** air quality sensor via I2C to monitor and log eCO₂ (equivalent CO₂) concentrations in real time.
- [`scd30`](https://github.com/RomuloPires88/scd30) This Python project continuously monitors CO₂ levels, temperature, and humidity using the **Sensirion SCD30 sensor**.

## 📚 What I'm learning
- `OpenFOAM` for simulating chemical reactions and flow
- `SciML.jl` in Julia for modeling dynamic systems
